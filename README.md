# Blocks_quickstart
This repo contains a simple demo of Blocks and Fuel.

The idea is to help new users get started as quickly as possible.

It should be really easy to use Blocks on top of your existing Theano code, if you follow the example script here.

If you have any problems, or suggestions for improving this demo, please let me know via the github issues!
